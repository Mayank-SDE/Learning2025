# Figma UI UX Design Essentials
## Rapid Prototyping
- Figma is used for rapid prototyping.
- Functional website without coding, just to give the clear idea to the client.
- First finalize the complete ui with great ux and then move forward with the developer.
## Figma Draw - Extended tool for drawing something.

## Difference between UI and UX ?
- UI stands for user interface and UX stands for user experience.
- UX builds trust.
- Good UX leads to better conversion.
- Iterating it quickly. Pain points faced by user using some app and which is functional but not the best experience to achieve any task.
- Clicking the submit button or just pressing the enter and submitting the form.
- UX is how people interact with your project.
- There are some UX best practices.
## What are we making in this course ?
- Whenever we will make applications we will make both desktop and mobile version of it as well.
- Building the whole application responsive and compatible with all the screen sizes.

## Wireframe vs High-Fidelity
- Wireframes are wireframes. Lines in the form of wire making out a layout altogether.
- High-Fidelity website are complete looking websites.
- We are gonna build the wireframe first and then test it and then later on we will be building the high fidelity of it.
- Use templates of figma once you get better but for now just do it manually.
- Frames are just like pages.
- Frames are containers for your designs and you can also use them to design ui elements.
- You can create any number of frames.
- You can click on the frame and directly click on the device for which you are styling for.
- Always design for mobile first and then tablet and then mobile and then Desktop.
- There is always the Recents tab using which you can always come back to the work you have done on a particular file last time.

## Basics of types and font in Figma
- There are two types of typing one is you click once and start typing.
    - Good for headings and as you type the width increases horizontally no line break it will kepp on continuing even if the frame gets broke.
- Another way is to click on the frame press T or select the T from the bottom nav-bar and then drag out the box which is a fixed size box inside which you can type whatever you want as text inside the frame.
    - Here as you type inside the box as you come near the box, the line gets break and it again starts from the second line.
- Inter is the default font in Figma and Roboto is good, Extra thin explore more.
- While wireframing do not use too many colours use gray use blue. Keep it simple and try and amke color coding later on.
- Stroke meaning lines around the box, square or we can say kind of border.
- Instead of grouping you can do frame selections.
- If we delete all the elements of the frame still the frame will exist and this will lead to alot of empty frame selection.
- If we delete all the elements of the group then no group will exist.
- For both frame and group you always ungroup.
- You can find good icons in place like iconfinder.com
- svg is always better than png. Because svg are scalabale and less in size as compared to pngs.
- pngs are not scalable and neither they are small in size.
- png and svg both are transaperent however. Transaperent means they support alpha channel we can add the opacity thing to them.
- png are not scalable means they are pixalated when you zoom the pixels get broke and larger files size for high resolution images.
- svg are easily editable and where pngs are not so easily editable in figma.
- Whenever u are downloading the svgs fro other application or website then it will always come as a frmae which you will not be needing oftenly so having said that you can put the icon vector outside the frame and delete the rectangle box.
- You can also explore the icons provided by figma community. By searching icons in the search bar of comunity in figma nd you can see various options and one of them is Heroicons. See it was never about the icons u are using it from where it is always about the style you want.
- “If it’s a photo → use raster. If it’s an icon → use vector. If it’s animation → use Lottie/WebP” etc., so you can keep it as a quick reference while designing?
- You can also use figma plugins where which can help you to extend the figma functionalities.
- SO you can have any popular plugins like unsplash, heroicons, iconify which could be free or paid depending upon you.
## Prototyping
